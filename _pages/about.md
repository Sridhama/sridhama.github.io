I do machine learning research in the [Turaga Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab){:target="_blank"} at [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"}. More specifically, I use variational inference and deep generative models to solve problems in neuroscience. Currently, I work on [connectomic-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome){:target="_blank"} and task-constrained neural networks for simulating whole-brain neural dynamics. My research also involves quantitatively understanding the accuracy of these neural simulations as a function of the amount of connectomic data available.

In the past, I've worked on variational spike inference from calcium fluorescence imaging, as well as some research in natural language processing.

In my free time, I enjoy reading 📚 and playing the violin 🎻. My favorite sports are soccer ⚽, chess ♟️, and table tennis 🏓.
