I do machine learning research in the [Turaga Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab){:target="_blank"} at [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"}. More specifically, I use variational inference and deep generative models to solve problems in neuroscience. Currently, I'm trying to create [connectomic-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome){:target="_blank"} and task-constrained neural networks for simulating population-level neural dynamics. My research also involves quantitatively understanding the accuracy of these neural simulations as a function of the amount of connectomic data available.

In the past, I've worked on variational spike inference from calcium fluorescence imaging, as well as some research in natural language processing.

In my free time, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/sridhama){:target="_blank"} 📚 and playing the violin 🎻 (both Western classical and Carnatic styles). My favorite sports are soccer ⚽, chess ♟️, and more recently, table tennis 🏓 --- which I picked up after joining Janelia.
