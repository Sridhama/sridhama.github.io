I work in the [Turaga Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab){:target="_blank"} at [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"}. I like solving problems in neuroscience using deep generative models and variational inference. Currently, my research involves simulating the _Drosophila_ larva's neural activity, at a population level, using [_connectomic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome){:target="_blank"} measurements. I also try to quantitatively understand the accuracy of these brain simulations as a function of the amount of available connectomic data.

In the past, I worked on variational spike inference from calcium fluorescence imaging, as well as some research in natural language processing.

In my free time, I enjoy reading 📚 and playing the violin 🎻 (both western and _Carnatic_ styles). My favorite sports are soccer ⚽, chess ♟️, and, more recently, table tennis 🏓 -- which I picked up after joining Janelia.
