I'm a computer science graduate student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"} and a student researcher in the [Connectomics group](https://research.google/teams/connectomics/){:target="_blank"} at [Google Research](https://research.google/){:target="_blank"}. Before grad school, I spent a couple of years developing machine learning algorithms for neuroscience in the [Turaga Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab){:target="_blank"} at [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org){:target="_blank"}. At Janelia, I mainly worked on building [connectome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome){:target="_blank"}-constrained latent variable models for simulating whole-brain neural dynamics. In the past, I’ve also worked on variational spike inference from calcium fluorescence imaging and some research in natural language processing.
